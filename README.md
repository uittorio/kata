# Kata

this repo is a workspace where I exercise kata challenges.

Some of them are a complete failure.

I've divided them by version so I will try to do them again in the future

- [rover](rover)
    - [v1](rover/v1)
- [wardrobe](wardrobe) 
    - [v1](wardrobe/v1)
- [ticTacToe](ticTacToe) 
    - [v1](ticTacToe/v1)


## Install
```js 
npm i
```

## Test
```js 
cd {project}/{version} // e.g cd rover/v1
npm test
```
